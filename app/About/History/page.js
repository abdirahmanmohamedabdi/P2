          <p className="text-lg font-font text-gray-600 mb-6">
            Mustaqbal was created to bridge the gap in access to education, technology, and leadership opportunities for women and youth in marginalized communities, particularly in the North Eastern regions of Kenya. In these areas, individuals face significant barriers to entering the workforce and accessing education, limiting their ability to thrive in a rapidly changing world.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg font-font text-gray-600">
            The organization was born out of a deep commitment to ensuring that everyone, regardless of their background, has the tools, resources, and opportunities to build a better future. Mustaqbal seeks to break the cycle of poverty and inequality by providing education, leadership training, and advocacy initiatives that focus on systemic change.
